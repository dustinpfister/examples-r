# examples-r

A few folders containing R programming language source code examples that I have started and will expand as I learn more about R. 

## Installing R, Version used

When I started this set of examples I was using R version 3.5.2 on Raspberry PI OS that was installed by way of what there is to work with in APT, rather than looking into how to go about building a later versionif possible.

```
$ uname -sr
Linux 5.10.103-v7l+
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt full-upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-core r-base-dev
```


```
$ R --version
R version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) -- "Eggshell Igloo"
